# ðŸŒ¿ PachaVerde

*A digital space for ecological connection, slow tech, and regenerative ideas.*

PachaVerde is an evolving project inspired by the land and a deep commitment to the living world. We're building a site and toolkit to share resources, links, and original content centered around ecology, permaculture, and community resilience.

This repository contains the codebase for [pachaverde.com](https://pachaverde.com) â€” a site rooted in care, built with modern tools, and shaped by the place we call home.
